#My C++ Dictionary/Hash Table implementation

Input file: A text file called "integers.txt" that contains 1000 integers 
Output: All the integers are placed into a unique index in a dynamically created array, and if a collision occurs the console outputs what integer already exists in the collided index and it will proceed to resolve the collision
